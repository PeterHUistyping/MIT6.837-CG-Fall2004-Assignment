## Setup the MyProject
*Notice that .C = .cpp (at least in VScode)
### Using VSCode C++ 
Using my code (on Mac Clang++)\
Note that you should open the Myproject folder,\
/lib contains vector-matrix-image header files or .C\
/ray contains the other.

You should replace four files in .vscode (in Myproject folder) with those from each corresponding .vscode-assignment*(0-9) (in assignment folder).\
.vscode-assignment*(0-9) is used for coding via the Myproject folder.

*In assignment 0, there are two ".vscode" folders\
.vscode-assignment0 is used for coding via the Myproject folder.\
.vscode-inside is used for coding via the assignment0_Barnsley fern folder. \
DO NEED to include everything from lib folder.

### Using Viusal Studio
Try doing it yourself.
